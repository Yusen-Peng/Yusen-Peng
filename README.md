My primary research interests lie in **vision-language models**. I always investigate different approaches to
designing such models with the emphasis on the following three aspects:
1. **Capability**: design robust, generalizable vision-language models that are data-adaptive and task-versatile
2. **Efficiency**: engineer computational efficient vision-language models with good performance tradeoffs
3. **Interpretability**: develop transparent vision-language models that explain their decision-making process
