My primary research interests lie in vision-language models. I always investigate different approaches to
designing such models with the emphasis on the following three aspects:
1. Capability: design robust, generalizable vision-language models that are data-adaptive and task-versatile
2. Efficiency: engineer computational efficient vision-language models with good performance tradeoffs
3. Interpretability: develop transparent vision-language models that explain their decision-making process
